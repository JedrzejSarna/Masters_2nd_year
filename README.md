# Projects during 2nd year of Masters Degree
All projects that I have worked on during second year of my Masters Degree in Statistical Data Analysis on AGH University in Krakow.
During the second year of my Master's Degree I had the opportunity to attend some very interesting courses including:

- Qualitative Data Analysis
- Linear Models 
- Resampling Methods
- Statistical Learning
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- Time Series
- Advanced machine learning methods

In each of the courses listed above, I had the opportunity to do a smaller or larger project that I would like to share here :)

**Note: Most of the projects are done in polish language as my lectures are in polish.**
